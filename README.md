Progress Tracking – A progress bar and question counter keep users informed of their position in the quiz, while the scoring system calculates results dynamically.

Responsive Design – The UI adapts seamlessly across devices with a clean layout, accessible color contrasts, and smooth transitions for interactions.

Performance & Security – Client-side processing ensures quick responses without server dependencies, coupled with input sanitization to prevent injection risks.

Engagement Features – Visual elements like the minimalist background, animated buttons, and post-quiz score breakdown enhance user retention.
